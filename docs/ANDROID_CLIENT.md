# ECHO — Android client

Status: **in progress** (2026-10-29) · Related: [Technical architecture](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md) §2.2 · [Visualizer](VISUALIZER_SPEC.md) · [Lyrics experience](LYRICS_EXPERIENCE.md) · [Design system](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)

A native Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Media3) for the owner's ECHO at
`https://echo.folk3s.com`. Owner decisions (2026-10-29): **full parity** with the web player (the
library, playback, the Stage with its room, Reverb, word-synced lyrics and liquid glass), **Kotlin +
Compose**, the server **fixed** to echo.folk3s.com, **Navidrome only** (Spotify's Web Playback SDK
cannot run in a third-party Android app; `PLAYBACK_ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.7).

## Architecture

| Web (`src/client`) | Android (`Android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/folk3s/echo`) |
|---|---|
| `api.ts`, session cookie | `api/Api.kt`: OkHttp with a **device token** (`POST /api/v1/auth/device`, `Authorization: Bearer echo_dt_…`; the Origin check exempts it), kept encrypted by an Android Keystore key |
| `library-navidrome.ts` | `library/Library.kt`: the same Subsonic calls through `/api/v1/navidrome/rest/*` |
| `playback/*` (an `<audio>` element) | `playback/`: a Media3 `MediaSessionService` (ExoPlayer, background playback, notification and lock-screen controls), streams from `/navidrome/stream/{id}` with the bearer header |
| `playback/analyser.ts` (Web Audio) | `playback/Features.kt`: the same FFT features from a `TeeAudioProcessor` tap |
| `stage/*` (three.js, WebGL 2) | `stage/`: OpenGL ES 3.0 with the same GLSL ES 3.00 shaders (room, energy, composite, glass, probe), the governor and Reverb ported as is |
| `stage/lyrics/*` | `stage/lyrics/`: timing, springs, beat and the field model ported as is; layout and drawing in Compose |
| `palette/m3.ts` | MaterialKolor's `SchemeContent` from the album accent |
| `ui/glass.ts` | Stage: the GL glass pass; Shell: an AGSL `RuntimeShader` over a recorded backdrop (API 33+), blur on 31–32, tint below |

The pure modules keep their names and structure so a change to one is easy to carry to the other.

## Build

`cd Android && ./gradlew assembleRelease` → `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`, copied
to `Android/ECHO.apk`. Release builds are minified and signed with the local debug key, which is
fine for sideloading; a Play release needs its own key. Needs the Android SDK with platform 37.2.

## Milestones

1. Scaffold, sign-in, library (albums, artists, playlists, starred, album, artist, search), theme.
2. Playback: the media service, dock, queue sheet, shuffle and repeat, the saved queue.
3. The Stage: room, palette, cover, brightness, modes, chrome auto-hide, governor, Reverb features.
4. Lyrics: the column with the sweep, glow, depth, dots, attribution and offsets.
5. Liquid glass: Stage (GL) and Shell (Compose), reduced transparency.
6. Settings (visuals, motion, lyrics size, sign out), accessibility pass, the APK.
